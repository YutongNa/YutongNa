## Hi there! I’m Yutong 👋

### 📖 About Me

🎓 I am a recent Master’s graduate in **Data Science &  Artificial Intelligence** from Queen Mary University of London, graduated with Distinction (average 85/100).  

📊 I am passionate about transforming data into actionable insights, with expertise in **machine learning, predictive modelling, statistical analysis, and data visualization**.  

💻 Proficient in **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL, and BI tools** such as Tableau and Power BI, I enjoy building end-to-end solutions from data cleaning and feature engineering to model deployment and reporting.  

📍 Currently based in London, working as a Data Analyst Intern at a ride-hailing platform, while seeking a full-time opportunity as a **Data Scientist / Data Analyst**.
